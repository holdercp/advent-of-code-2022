# Advent of Code 2022

This year I'm writing my solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I work in web dev on the front-end, so JS and TS are my bread and butter, but I like to use Advent of Code to dabble in other languages.

To continue to grow as an engineer and broaden my skillset, I wanted to pick up a compiled language that I could use in applications other than web. I chose Rust for several reasons:

- It's compiled, statically typed, and has different concepts relative to JS, like ownership.
- It's modern, fast, and makes it harder to create footguns around memory management.
- It's learning curve is steep but the reward seems to be great.
- It's gaining popularity and industry adoption.

I think learning Rust will be challenging and fun.

I'm going to be doing something new this year too: I will be doing little write-ups for each day that capture my thought process in solving the problems. I've benefitted from others doing the same in past years, so I think it's time to pay it forward.

Good luck!
